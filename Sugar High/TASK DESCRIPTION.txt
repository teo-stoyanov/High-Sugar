SUGAR HIGHT DESCRIPTION

I split the program in a different packages 
--- interfaces - where are the interfaces for our classes (used for bigger abstraction and easier changes later on in the program)
--- io - where are the classes for the input and output (ConsoleReader and ConsoleWriter) 
--- logic - where are main logic is with class Engine
--- and a class Main 
The main logic is also explained in the class Engine
1. We read from the console array of strings, than we split it (by regex), filter the empty entries,
   map each element, parse it to integer and collect it in a List - which allow us more functionality later on.
2. Read the next integet - threshold
3. Create a new Arr so we can coppy the List than sort it ascending
4. Create a new List which we will use it to store the indices of each candy we can eat
5. Iterate true the sorted array, add its value in a sum and if its lower than our threshold we add its indice,
when we reach the limit we break the loop (no need of extra iterations);
6.Sort the new List than Join it by  ", " and print it on the console.
